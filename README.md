# README
HW18

## Description
This challenge involved using Google Colab to prepare data, create a neural network model, evaluate the model, predict loan repayment and finally make some recommendations. Although I was able to complete the homework, I am not confident that I completely understand how the hidden layers work. I plan to spend more time studying how to compile and evaluate a neural network. I did figure out how Colab works, which will be helpful as we move on to more complex data sets.

## Assistance
I mainly used the activities from Module 18 to figure out how to complete this homework. However, I did use Tabnine to assist with some syntax. I also attended office hours to get assistance with saving the project in Colab.
